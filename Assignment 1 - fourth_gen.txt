                               Fourth Generation (1971-1980) 
                       Microprocessors Are the Start of Modern Computers

The fourth generation computers was developed using microprocessor. Intel 4004 chip was the first microprocessor developed in 1971. The microprocessor is a silicon chip contains millions of transistors that was designed using LSI and VLSI technology. 
The fourth generation computers used LSI (Large Scale Integration) and VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) technology. Using LSI and VLSI technology thousands of transistors are integrated on a small silicon chip. In fourth generation computers the semiconductor memory is replaced by magnetic core memory resulting in fast random access to memory.
The instructions to the computer were written in high level language instead of machine language and assembly language.

Advantages
More reliable than previous generation computers.
Perform calculations in Picoseconds.
Consumes less power than the previous generation computers.
No air conditioning is required.
Totally general purpose.
Cost is low compared to the previous generation computers.
All types of high level languages is used for fourth generation computers.
Maintenance cost is low compared to the previous generation computers.
Fourth generation computers are portable.
Generates less heat than the previous generation computers.
Learning high level language is easier than assembly and machine language.

One disadvantage is that latest technology is required for manufacturing of microprocessors. 

What defines generation 4?
Characteristics of the fourth generation include:
Much Less Expensive
More Portable
Much Smaller Size
Usage of the Internet
Computers were More Easily Available to Everyone; PCs
BASIC Computer Language
Computer Mouse and GUI make Computers More Personable

Some Computers of the fourth generation include:
ALTAIR 8800
